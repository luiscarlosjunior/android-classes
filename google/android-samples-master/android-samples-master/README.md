Pre-requisites
--------------

See each sample for pre-requisites.
All require up-to-date versions of the Android build tools and the Android support repository.

Getting Started
---------------

These samples use the Gradle build system.

First download the samples by cloning this repository or downloading an archived
snapshot. (See the options at the top of the page.)

In Android Studio, use the "Import non-Android Studio project" or
"Import Project" option. Next select one of the sample directories that you downloaded from this
repository.
If prompted for a gradle configuration accept the default settings.

Alternatively use the "gradlew build" command to build the project directly.

Search for `YOUR_API_KEY` in the project and replace it with your API key.
Some samples store this in the gradle.properties file and others store it in the google_maps_api.xml file.
See the [Get Started with Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started) 
guide to get an API key.
